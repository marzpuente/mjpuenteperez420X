I decided to go with what was fresh in my mind and find a way to merge multiple assignments together into the final thing! I implemented features from Assignment 1,2 and 4.

This sandbox experience features multiple forms of interaction. Users are able to edit a set of variables and presets to their liking, as well as interact with the
simulation directly in their webcam. It is very fun to push around and break up blobs in the simulation.

I would say I spent most of my time testing features and different presets in order to find the right atmosphere for the experience. I tried many different types of
music, physarum presets, and interaction models.

Some key features Im proud of:

1. Music player, adds christmas music to the atmosphere of the sandbox. I originally wanted to go with a song named Computer Love by Zapp. I was hoping to get the color of the
agents to change according to the music. Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to change the color selector dynamically in tweakpane.

2. Physarum simulation, From Assignment 4, this simulation was easy to understand and bend to my will. One thing I wish I could have done was add a gravity effect
that would help solidfy the christmas atmosphere.

3. Webcam integration, I was able to successfully import the RGB video data alongside physarum. This resulted in some very interesting interactions between the user
and the simulation.

4. Tweakpane options menu with folder, I added the same tweakpane from A4 however I improved the UI by adding a folder and hiding the presets. I hid the presents
because I felt that playing with the sliders resulted in an more interesting experience.
