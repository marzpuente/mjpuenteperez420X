  I decided to work with a simple noise function I found online. I use this noise in order to create the look of radiation on the green image. 
Each of the fallout games are known for having a specific, movie-like, filter added on top of the gameplay. Fallout 3 is Green, Fallout New Vegas is Orange, and Fallout 4 has a warmer color space.

I chose Fallout 3 as my favorite of the bunch and actually picked the color straight from a screenshot of gameplay. The green really adds to the nuclear wasteland feel
unlike any of the other releases. A different screenshot was used as the background of the webpage

I also wanted to replicate the blur that happens in game when you are injured or an explosion goes off near you. Unfortunately, I was not able to implement it here.
I was able to implement an intensity factor that I was not able to make user customizable. But the intensity factor could increase the amount of noise. However, the current
value was chosen on purpose as any higher results in an image that is not very usable.

One last thing I would have added was some background music to set an apocolyptic mood!

Final Paragraph: I was unable to get feedback due to the end of the term. I would say that I hit most of my expectations. However I wish I could have implemented some
wave forms from my Assignment 1 as well as implementing noise into the project.
