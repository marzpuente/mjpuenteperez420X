Preset 1 - RotateBool: This preset causes agents to sort of circle each other. Turning up the rotation multiplier while in this mode causes all agents to move in similar
directions, creating a shifting effect(maybe a better name for this preset) This preset alters the rotate multiplier.

Preset 2 - Galaxy: This preset causes all agents to group up together and pull away from the sides of the screen. I especially like using galaxy alongside group. as it results
in a really cool looking spacelike image. changing the sliders also has some interesting behavior

Preset 3 - Group: this preset groups agents together. Depending on what preset you ran before you can get some interesting looking groupings.

Preset 4 - Fireworks: This preset does the opposite of group! it has an expanding characteristic that results it in mostly looking like noise. Probably my least favorite preset but
it was simple to make as it affects the agent sensors primarily.

If I could do another preset. I would do something called trypophobia. I was able to produce a flesh-like lattice across the screen in a red color. Unfortunately I didnt
save the presets before reloading :(
